# Min-Z80
Min-Z80 is a minimal single-board computer based on the Z80 microprocessor. The project was originally inspired by Ben Eater and his series on building a simple 6502 based computer, but, since I wasn't able to find any 6502 processor for following along, I decided to go my own way and build something similar based on the Z80. 

## Basic specs

* Z80 processor running at maximum 1MHz
* 32K ROM
* 32K RAM
* 4 column LCD display
* SN76489 sound chip
